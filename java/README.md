# Java
This folder contains a Java project that was implemented during the Java course. There will be a torrent implementation in the next term!

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in software development projects. It uses blobs, commits, and trees to store and access code changes. Hashes are calculated using SHA-256. This project implements features like initialization, adding and removing files, committing changes, resetting to previous versions, and branching. For more information, please refer to the [Git README](./git/README.md).

## Functional Java

Functional Java focuses on functional programming concepts in the Java language. It provides abstractions like functions and predicates, along with operations such as composition, binding, and currying. It promotes code reusability, immutability, and declarative programming paradigms. For detailed information, please visit the [Functional README](./functional/README.md).

## Persistent Array

The Persistent Array project implements a data structure that maintains immutability while allowing efficient modifications. It utilizes path copying techniques and provides persistence, meaning modifications create new instances without altering the original array. It supports versioning and operations like element retrieval, insertion, and deletion. For more details, please refer to the [Persistent Array README](./persistent array/README.md).

## Trie

A Trie is a tree-like data structure commonly used for efficient string manipulation. It provides fast prefix searching, insertion, and deletion operations. The Trie project focuses on implementing a Trie data structure with features such as prefix searching, insertion, and deletion. For additional information, please visit the [Trie README](./trie/README.md).
