This repository contains the programs that were written during my Master's program on MSE ITMO.

### [Algorithms](./algorithms/)
Contains algorithms written in C++ language for contests on Codeforces. Includes binary search and various data structures such as deque, priority queue, binary search tree, range tree, etc.

For more detailed information, refer to the [README](./algorithms/README.md) file.

### [C++](./cpp/)
A 2-term course that includes 4 major homework assignments:

- [Multi-Precision Arithmetic Library](./cpp/bignum/README.md)
- [Matrices](./cpp/matrices/README.md)
- [variant](./cpp/variant/README.md)
- [Whatever](./cpp/whatever/README.md) (boost::any)

Additionally, it includes some interesting programs written during the course. Refer to the [README](./cpp/README.md) file for more details.

### [Java](./java/)
During this course, the following programs were implemented:

- [Git](./java/git)
- [Functional](./java/functional) (implements functional programming concepts in the Java language)
- [Persistent Array](./java/functional/) (implements a data structure that maintains immutability while allowing efficient modifications)
- [Trie](./java/trie/) (a tree-like data structure for efficient string manipulation)

### [Python](./python/)
Scripts that utilize magic methods, generators, and decorators.

For more information, see the [README](./python/README.md) file.

### [High performance computing](./hpc/)
During this course [Lock Free Set](./hpc/lock_free_set) in Java was implemented
